# html-extractor
extracting Recipe object from html file used in conjunction with MixMix to populate database with recipe entries.

Looking to further develop with other recipe-types, having schemas for different layouts.
Intended to be a plugin-type api for a given url.
A middle-man of sorts to stand in enable https requests ontop of the existing html.
